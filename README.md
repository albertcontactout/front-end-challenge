## The Challenge

Create a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

### Requirements 
* Simple to use interface.
* The ability search the OMDB API and return a list of movies that show at least the title, release year and a button to nominate them. 
* Search results should only be of movies.
* Updates to the search terms should update the result list.
* If a movie has been nominated already, it's button should be disabled within the search results. 
* Nominated movies should move to their own "Nomination List".
* Movies in the nomination list should be able to be removed.
* Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.
